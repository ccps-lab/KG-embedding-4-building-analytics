### Knowledge graph embedding for building analytics
This repository contains codes and data associated with an ongoing series of research experiments which is focused on the use of “knowledge graphs” and their “semantic embedding” to enable downstream machine learning over the content of the knowledge graphs that are created for the built environment.

Codes and data for associated research publications is also included to ensure reproducibility of the reported results.
