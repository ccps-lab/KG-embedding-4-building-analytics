### Case study description:
The code and data shared here ensures reproducability of the results reported in our paper published at [EC3-2022 conference](https://ec-3.org/publications/conference/paper/?id=EC32022_208).
The semantic model used in these experiments was obtained from a public online [repository](http://smartlab1.elis.ugent.be:8889/IFC-repo/) maintained by a research lab at Ghent University, Belgium.
The entities dataset has been created by running SPARQL queries to retrieve the instances of beam and wall objects from the semantic model (i.e., knowledge graph).
